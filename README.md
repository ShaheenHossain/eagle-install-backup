This script is based on the install script from Andr√© Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts)
but goes a bit further. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/
This script can be safely used in a multi-odoo code base server because the default Odoo port is changed BEFORE the Odoo is started.
